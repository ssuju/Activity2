      <h1>About me:</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Suju Sapkota and I am a senior at The University of Nebraska
        Omaha. I was born in Germany but I am from Nepal. We moved to
        <span class="bold"> The Land of Opportunity </span> when I was eight, so
        I was raised in Nebraska.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I love to spend time with friends and family. I also
        love traveling and experiencing new things. When I turned 18, I
        immediately bought a ticket to go to Australia on my own during the
        summer. It was the best summer and one my favorite experiences so far.
        Last summer, I took a trip to Nepal. This summer, I visited Colorado and
        Chicago with my friends. My family and I went on a east coast trip to
        drop of my brother at Brown University. We visited Virginia, Ohio,
        Delware, New York, Conneticut, and Rhode Island.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also sing and dance. I don't believe I am the best but I love having
        fun on stage. During Nepalese festivals, I participate to perserve my
        culture. I also choreograph dances when I have time. Choreographing
        cultural dances not only reminds me who I am and where I am from, but it
        also teaches the dancer about your values and tradition.

      <p>
        Like I stated earlier, I love traveling! Besides traveling, I love
        listening to music. I have Apple Music and it's the greatest invention.
        Music helps me when I am stressed out or sad. It changes my mood from
        happy to sad and vice versa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other than music and traveling, I enjoy driving. I love late night
        crusing and just long drives overall. I love meeting new people and
        trying different things. I am planning on taking more trips with my
        friends. One of my destination includes seeing some European countries.
