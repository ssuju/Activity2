      <h1>Mutual of Omaha:</h1>

      <p>
        Summer 2019 was special for me as I got my first internship with
        <span class="bold">Mutual of Omaha</span>. I started eariler than the
        other interns and I cannot believe the amount of knowledge I gained! I
        am still learning but everyday feels like a challege to me and I love
        challenges. I first started out with Teradata, a database application I
        had never heard of. There, I accquired some skills on how Database
        Adminstrators maintain/support Teradata. I granted database access,
        created new users and tables, and granted roles. Then, I got to
        experience Informatica and created my first map. Now, I teach a class
        that introduces Mutual of Omaha employees to the basics of Informatica
        PowerCenter. Currently, I am working with The Data Lineage Team, where I
        scan metadata for different applications. Along with that, I am working
        on a SQL project where we are helping a team build their database
        foundation. I am continuing my internship this fall (2019) and spring.

      <h1>Quotes:</h1>
      <p>
        I love listening to wise words from wise/successful people. Below are
        some of my favorite quotes that motivate me.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>Attitude:</h3>
        <p>
          If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change
          your attitude.
        </p>

      <blockquote>
        <h3>Family:</h3>
        <p>The most important thing in the world is family and love.</p>
        <cite><span class="italics"> -John Wooden </span></cite>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <h3>Technology and Business:</h3>
        <p>
          Information technology and business are becoming inextricably
          interwoven. I don't think anybody can talk meaningfully about one
          without the talking about the other.
